Some scripts to make Ubuntu 12.04 on HP Folio 13 a better experience.

* suspend-lid-closed: checks every 2 seconds to see if lid is closed and suspends
laptop if it is, fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1010926 .
This does not respect system "When lid is closed" setting in Power settings, it always
just suspends if the lid is closed.

WARNING:
This may cause your laptop to explode in a ball of fire. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.
